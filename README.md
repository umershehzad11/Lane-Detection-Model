This project implements a real-time lane detection system using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. The model identifies road lanes in video or image input by applying edge detection, region of interest masking, and perspective transforms. It demonstrates key concepts in computer vision such as Canny edge detection and image warping to isolate and highlight lane lines accurately. This project strengthened my skills in image processing, algorithm design, and real-time application development, providing hands-on experience with tools commonly used in autonomous vehicle systems.
